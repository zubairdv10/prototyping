Advantages of prototyping:

1.Reduced time and cost- improves quality of the specifications and requirements provided to the customer ,with this they can expect higher costs, needed changes and potential project hurdles and most importantly end result disaster
2.Improved and increased user involovment
3.Technically understand problems
4.Conflict resolution

Disadvantages of prototyping:

1.Insufficient analysis- focusing on a limited prototype can distract developers from properly analyzing the complete project
2.User confusion- customers may not understand that the rough prototypes need to be finished or polished up
3.Development miunderstanding of user objectives- for any project to be successful the developer and the customer need to be on the same page and share the same project objectives 
4.Excessive development time
